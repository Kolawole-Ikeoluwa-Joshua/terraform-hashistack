## Key Components:

- `Security`: The Bastion host secures access to the internal network.
- `Service Discovery`: Consul enables dynamic service discovery and configuration management.
- `Load Balancing`: HAProxy and Traefik/Nginx handle load balancing and routing, ensuring high availability and efficient traffic distribution.
- `Orchestration`: Nomad manages the deployment and lifecycle of applications and services.

### Network / Traffic Flow:

The traffic flow for this setup would generally follow this sequence:

1. `External Client Access via Bastion Host - Bastion`: Acts as a secure entry point for administrators to access the internal network. Administrators can SSH into the bastion host and then access other components within the private network.

2. `Service Discovery and Configuration Management - Consul`: Manages service discovery and configuration across the infrastructure. It maintains a registry of all services (like Nomad, HAProxy, and Traefik) and provides a way to discover and configure them dynamically.

3. `Load Balancing and Reverse Proxy - HAProxy`: Balances the load among multiple instances of services. HAProxy can be configured using service data from Consul to ensure it always has up-to-date information about service instances. Internal services communicate directly or through HAProxy for load balancing.

4. `Application Deployment and Orchestration - Nomad`: Deploys and orchestrates applications and services based on defined jobs. Nomad schedules and manages the lifecycle of containerized and non-containerized applications, ensuring they are running according to specified configurations. Applications register with Consul upon startup. Nomad ensures high availability and manages scaling, updates, and failures.

5. `Edge Routing and Load Balancing for Microservices - Traefik`: Functions as an edge router for microservices, handling routing, load balancing, and SSL termination. Traefik can integrate with Consul to automatically update its routing rules based on service changes. Receives client requests, dynamically routes them based on Consul's service registry, and balances the load among service instances. `Routing and Load Balancing - Nginx`: Acts as a web server and reverse proxy for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It can also be configured to use Consul for service discovery, providing additional routing and load balancing capabilities for the appropriate backend service.
